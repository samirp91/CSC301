# Report

This report should encourage you to reflect on your work, as well as provide your TA more insight into how you worked together.

 * Fill-in the information below (i.e. replace every _TODO item_ with actual content).
 * Be concise and write clearly! You need to make it as easy as possbile for reader (i.e. The TA) to understand.
 * Focus on your personal experience during this assignment (i.e. don't quote some general statement about collaboration).
 * Focus on information, not power words.
 

## Challenges

List the most challenging aspects of your work (from most to least challenging).
These can be related to collaborating with other students, using one of the tools, a difficult technical concept, etc.

 1. Eugene - The desktop application made a separate branch during one of the conflicts but kept the same files. I couldnt figure out what was wrong because it wasnt doing what I expected it to, so I ended up deleting the branch and trying in cmd line.
 2. Samir - My partner updated the file and submitted a pull request which I merged. After merging it, I wanted to try some updates and the file that my partner updated got messed up on my end. I tried reverting it and I kept getting some error about a conflict and commiting. I then went online and found out I had to use git reset --hard <old-commit-id>.

## Interesting pull-requests, issues and commits

Provide links to (what you consider to be) your most interesting pull-requests, issues and/or commits (from most to least interesting).       
_Tip:_ Issues (or pull-requests) that contain a discussion are probably interesting.

 1. [Link](https://github.com/eu-wong/assignment-pair-programming-handout-team5/commit/03bf3f51499a15712ce5e9fa74ba9c724251d14b) - was interesting because I had no idea what the desktop application was doing and struggled to get it to merge, but it ended up mashing up the differences in the files instead of accepting my edit. 
 2. [First ever merge](https://github.com/samirp91/assignment-pair-programming-handout-team5/commit/8c3b211ec2ffba26075adfe096195bbb0d8ddf64) - this was interesting for me because I had never seen how files merge and in svn, I would get a message saying that there's a conflict and I would have to choose my file or their file. This just added the changes as long as there was nothing conflicting.



## Lessons learned from teammate

Please tell us about one thing that your teammate does really well, and that you can/did learn from them.
This can be their time management methods, communication skills, programming trick(s), coding style, a technical concept you didn't know before, etc.

One thing I was reminded of from Eugene was that when making a constant field in java, you should use all uppercase and underscores for spaces. I knew this but I had forgotten about it.

#### g4patelt

if samir didn't double check requirements this readme file would probably be empty. I have learned to double check requirements from him.
