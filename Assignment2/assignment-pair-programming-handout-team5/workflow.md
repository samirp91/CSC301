# Collaborative Work

One of the main goals of this assignment is to get you used to some of the tools used by professional software engineers.

Specifically, we would like you to:
 * Keep track of your tasks using [issues][github-issues].        
   * An open issue corresponds to a task you need to complete. 
   * Once the task is completed, you should close the issue.
 * Synchronize your work using [pull-requests][github-pull-requests].
   * Use pull-requests to ask your teammate to pull changes _from your fork_ into _their fork_.
 * Keep your (relevant) written discussions as part of these issues and pull-requests (instead of email).


_Tip:_ Both, issues and pull-requests, have a number of fairly simple, yet extremely useful, features:

 * They can be assigned to a user.
 * They can be [labeled][github-labels] (a similar concept to hash-tags).
 * Users can comments on them and develop a discussion.
 * Support for [Markdown][github-markdown] and [a few other goodies](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references).


## First Step

Get together (in person or online) and decide how to divide the work.

_Note:_ You must communicate with your teammate, _before_ you start working on the code.

## Workflow

Once you start working, we expect each of you to follow this general workflow:

 1. Create a new issue (i.e. A task you need to complete)
 2. In your local clone, commit changes that fix the issue.       
    _Pro Tip:_ you can/should [refer to issues in your commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
 3. Push the code (from your local clone to your fork on GitHub).
 4. Submit a pull-request against your teammate's fork.


You (and your teammate) will need to gain some experience with the tools, before you learn how to use them optimally. Please keep that in mind, be patient with one another, give constructive criticism and share useful information with your teammate. 

We also listed a number of best practices that will help you become a good collaborator.


## Best Practices


#### Git

 * Keep your commits small.
 * Write meaningful commit messages.
 * Commit and push often - It is much easier to stay in-sync when you both know the state of each other's code.


#### Issues

 * Be concise, yet informative.
 * Take advantage of Markdown - Links, code snippets, screenshots, etc.
 * Use labels.        
   Feel free to create/delete labels as you see fit.
 * If you find a bug in your teammate's code, create an issue and assign it to them.          
   It is not rude to assign someone an issue. In fact, you are doing them a favour by making their work easier.
 * Issues should correspond to short-term, concrete tasks.       
   _Example:_ Create class X, implement getter and setters for class Y, etc.
 * Try to keep the "average lifetime" of an issue short.         
   _Example:_ Open issues for tasks (you estimate) you can complete in the next 24 hours.

#### Pull-Requests

 * Submit pull-requests regularly and frequently.      
   Ideally, you will submit a pull-request every time you close an issue.
 * Respond (i.e. merge, comment or reject) to your teammate's pull-requests as quickly as possible.

#### Communication

 * You may find [Slack][slack] (or any other instant messaging tool) useful.
